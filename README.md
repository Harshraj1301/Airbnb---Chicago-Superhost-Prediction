## Project Objective

Utilized Airbnb's datasets to address real-time challenges within the Airbnb ecosystem in Chicago through robust modeling techniques.

## Key Highlights

### Predictive Model for Superhost Status
- Developed a Logistic Regression model to forecast Airbnb 'Superhost' status with 84% accuracy.
- Identified key factors influencing Superhost recognition, aiding hosts in understanding and achieving Superhost status.

### Strategic Investment Insights
- Employed the Herfindahl Index to assess market concentration and competitiveness across various neighborhoods in Chicago.
- Provided strategic recommendations for potential investors, focusing on optimizing return on investment (ROI) by identifying high-potential areas for new Airbnb listings.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed trends and patterns in the raw data to differentiate between hosts and Superhosts.
- Key findings showed that Superhosts generally have higher ratings, response averages, and booked days compared to regular hosts.

### Data Preprocessing
- Enhanced data quality by removing irrelevant features and handling missing values using Gradient Boosting for imputation.
- Addressed multicollinearity to improve model performance and ensure robust predictions.

### Investment Decision Support
- Analyzed property prices and revenue to calculate potential returns on investment.
- Suggested neighborhoods with high ROI potential, considering the competitive landscape and revenue generation capabilities.

### Occupancy Rate Prediction
- Forecasted occupancy rates using a Random Forest model, achieving a MAPE of 3.80% on the test data.
- Insights revealed an 8% increase in occupancy rate for properties predicted to achieve Superhost status.

### Business Insights & Recommendations
- **Promotion of Superhost Program:** Continue promoting the Superhost certification to maintain high-quality standards and enhance guest satisfaction.
- **Support for New Hosts:** Provide resources and incentives for new hosts to become Superhosts, particularly in areas with fewer Superhosts.
- **Neighborhood Marketing:** Highlight neighborhoods with high concentrations of Superhosts in marketing campaigns.
- **Comprehensive Listings:** Educate hosts on the importance of thorough and attractive property listings, emphasizing the impact of having 10-20 high-quality photos.
- **Strategic Location Focus:** Leverage the reputation of high-performing neighborhoods like Lakeview and suggest competitive strategies for other areas.
- **Property Type Optimization:** Recommend investing in studio apartments, as they have a higher likelihood of achieving Superhost status.
